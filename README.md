# Lab 9-2 Plan and Create

1. **Read textbook pages 307 through 314. Note that your book gives instructions for setting up development tools and a development environment. Ignore those instructions. We are using Replit instead. Figure 9-34 on page 314 gives the final C++ instructions to be submitted. Please do not just copy and paste. Working through Lab 9-2 will get you used to developing, building, testing, and pushing/submitting your code**i

2. **Test the program using the same data used to desk-check the program. You can compile and run your code with the following commands:**
```
make clean
make lab9-2
./lab9-2
```
**You can also use the unit test for testing your code by running the following:** 
``` 
make test_lab9-2
./test_files/test_lab9-2
```

3. **When you are done, push your code to the Github classroom. A Github Action will grade your lab.**

# Homework 9-19

**In this exercise, you will modify the car payment program from Lab 9-2. Make the modifications listed in Figure 9-39. Test the program appropriately.**

![Figure 9-39](images/figure9-39.png)


```
make clean
make hw9-19
./hw9-19
```
**You can also use the unit test for testing your code by running the following:** 
``` 
make test_hw9-19
./test_files/test_hw9-19
```


# Lab 10-2 Plan and Create

1. **Read textbook pages 347 through 355. Note that your book gives instructions for setting up development tools and a development environment. Ignore those instructions. We are using Replit instead. Figure 10-22 on page 354 gives the final C++ instructions to be submitted. Please do not just copy and paste. Working through Lab 10-2 will get you used to developing, building, testing, and pushing/submitting your code**i

2. **Test the program using the same data used to desk-check the program. You can compile and run your code with the following commands:**
```
make clean
make lab10-2
./lab10-2
```
**You can also use the unit test for testing your code by running the following:** 
``` 
make test_lab10-2
./test_files/test_lab10-2
```

3. **When you are done, push your code to the Github classroom. A Github Action will grade your lab.**

# Homework 10-13

**In this exercise, you will modify the program from Lab 9-2 in Chapter 9. Copy the instructions from the Lab9-2.cpp file. (Alternatively, you can enter the instructions from Figure 9-34 into the ModifyThis13.cpp file.) Change the getPayment function to a void function. Test the program appropriately.**

```
make clean
make hw10-13
./hw10-13
```
**You can also use the unit test for testing your code by running the following:** 
``` 
make test_hw10-13
./test_files/test_hw10-13
```
